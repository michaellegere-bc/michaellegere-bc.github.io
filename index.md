## Welcome to my website!

Hello! My name is Michael and I am currently a Master’s Student at Boston College studying Philosophy. My academic interests generally concern Marxism + Materialism, Political + Economic Philosophy, Education, Science, and History. More specifically, I am interested in theories of Ideology, Violence, Alienation + Interpellation, and the History of Western Philosophy. This site is a sort of living resume where you can learn about me and what I’m up to.

This is my CV! [CV Jan 2022 ML.pdf]
